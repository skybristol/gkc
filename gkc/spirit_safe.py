Spirit Safe: Quality gates and validation framework (Reserved for future development).

The Spirit Safe is reserved for future development of comprehensive quality
gate and validation functionality for the GKC data distillery workflow.

Previous ShEx validation functionality has been moved to gkc.shex module.

Named after the locked cabinet in traditional distilleries where the master
distiller inspects and approves the product before it's sent to barrel aging
or bottling.

Plain meaning: Future home for quality control and validation gates.

# This module is currently a placeholder for future Spirit Safe functionality.
# ShEx validation has been moved to gkc.shex - use ShexValidator instead.
